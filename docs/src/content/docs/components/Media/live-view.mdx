The `LiveView` component enables embedding dynamic textures rendered by the engine into the UI.

## Usage

To render a live view in your UI, use the `LiveView` component as shown below:

```jsx
import LiveView from '@components/Media/LiveView/LiveView';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <LiveView src={'TextureRenderTarget2D\'/Game/LiveViews/LiveViewRT.LiveViewRT\''} style={{ width: '150px', height: '150px' }} />
    );
};

export default App;
```

### Styling the Component

You can style the `LiveView` component using either the `class` or `style` attribute.

For inline styles, pass an object with the desired properties. For example, you can set the `width` and `height` of the image as shown [here](#usage).

However, for better performance, it is recommended to use the `class` attribute. To do this, create a CSS file with the desired styles and apply them to the `LiveView` component:

**MyLiveView.module.css:**

```css
.my-live-view {
    width: 150px;
    height: 150px;
}
```

```jsx
import LiveView from '@components/Media/LiveView/LiveView';
import styles from './MyLiveView.module.css';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <LiveView src={'TextureRenderTarget2D\'/Game/LiveViews/LiveViewRT.LiveViewRT\''} class={styles['my-live-view']} />
    );
};

export default App;
```


### Fill the container

To make the `LiveView` component fill its container, set the `fill` property to `true`. 
This will apply styles to ensure the image occupies the entire space of its parent element. This prop is useful when you want the image to just adapt to the size of its container.

```tsx
import LiveView from '@components/Media/LiveView/LiveView';
import MyImage from '../../assets/my-image.png';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div style={{ width: "10vmax", height: "10vmax" }}>
            <LiveView fill src={'TextureRenderTarget2D\'/Game/LiveViews/LiveViewRT.LiveViewRT\''} />
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;
```

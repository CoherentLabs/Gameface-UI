The `Image` component is designed to render image assets in your UI, utilizing the `img` HTML element internally.

## Usage

To render an image asset in your UI, use the `Image` component as follows:

1. First, import the asset into your file:

```jsx
import MyImage from '../../assets/my-image.png';
```

2. Then, render the image using the `Image` component by setting its `src` attribute:

```jsx
<Image src={MyImage} />
```

And the full example:

```jsx
import Image from '@components/Media/Image/Image';
import MyImage from '../../assets/my-image.png';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <Image src={MyImage} style={{ width: '150px', height: '150px' }} />
    );
};

export default App;
```

### Applying styles to the component

To style the image through the `Image` component, you can use either the `class` or `style` attribute.

For inline styles, pass an object with the desired properties. For example, you can set the `width` and `height` of the image as shown [here](#usage).

However, using the `class` attribute is recommended for better performance. To use the `class` attribute, create a CSS file defining the image styles and apply them to the `Image` component:

**MyImage.module.css:**

```css
.my-image {
    width: 150px;
    height: 150px;
}
```

```jsx
import Image from '@components/Media/Image/Image';
import MyImage from '../../assets/my-image.png';
import styles from './MyImage.module.css';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <Image src={MyImage} class={styles['my-image']} />
    );
};

export default App;
```

### Fill the container

To make the `Image` component fill its container, set the `fill` property to `true`. 
This will apply styles to ensure the image occupies the entire space of its parent element. This prop is useful when you want the image to just adapt to the size of its container.

```tsx
import Image from '@components/Media/Image/Image';
import MyImage from '../../assets/my-image.png';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <div style={{ width: "10vmax", height: "10vmax" }}>
            <Image fill src={MyImage} />
        </div>
    );
};

export default App;
```

title: Accordion Menu
---
The `Accordion` component is a vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each reveal an associated section of content. 
It allows users to expand and collapse sections to show or hide their content.

## Usage

To include an accordion in your UI, wrap one or more `Accordion.Panel` components within the `Accordion` component. 
Each panel contains an `Accordion.Heading` and an `Accordion.Body`:

```tsx
import Accordion from '@components/Basic/Accordion/Accordion';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <Accordion>
            <Accordion.Panel>
                <Accordion.Heading>Heading 1</Accordion.Heading>
                <Accordion.Body>Accordion content</Accordion.Body>
            </Accordion.Panel>
            <Accordion.Panel>
                <Accordion.Heading>Heading 2</Accordion.Heading>
                <Accordion.Body>Accordion content</Accordion.Body>
            </Accordion.Panel>
        </Accordion>
    );
};

export default App;
```

#### Usage

Creating an accordion menu with an expanded panel by default.

```diff lang="tsx"
import Accordion from '@components/Basic/Accordion/Accordion';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <Accordion>
+            <Accordion.Panel expanded title="panel1">
+                <Accordion.Heading>Heading 1</Accordion.Heading>
+                <Accordion.Body>Accordion content</Accordion.Body>
+            </Accordion.Panel>
            <Accordion.Panel title="panel2">
                <Accordion.Heading>Heading 2</Accordion.Heading>
                <Accordion.Body>Accordion content</Accordion.Body>
            </Accordion.Panel>
        </Accordion>
    );
};

export default App;
```

:::caution
If no `title` prop is provided to `Accordion.Panel`, a unique identifier will be generated automatically. 
If you plan to programmatically manipulate the panel, it is recommended to specify a `title`.
:::

## Slots

### `Accordion.Heading`

The `Accordion.Heading` slot is used inside an `Accordion.Panel` to define the clickable heading for that panel.
It displays the panel's title or label and handles user interaction for expanding or collapsing the panel.

#### Properties

#### Properties

| Prop Name   | Type                | Default   | Description                                                                                  |
|-------------|---------------------|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

:::note
By default the icon will rotate by 180 degrees when the panel is expanded. You can customize this behavior by providing a custom class or styles to the icon slot.
:::

#### Usage

To use a custom icon, provide your desired content as children of the Accordion.Icon slot:

```diff lang="tsx"
import Accordion from '@components/Basic/Accordion/Accordion';
import CustomIcon from '@assets/CustomIcon';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <Accordion>
            <Accordion.Panel expanded title="panel1">
                <Accordion.Heading>
                    Heading 1
+                    <Accordion.Icon>
+                        <CustomIcon />
+                    </Accordion.Icon>
                </Accordion.Heading>
                <Accordion.Body>Accordion content</Accordion.Body>
            </Accordion.Panel>
            <Accordion.Panel title="panel2">

                <Accordion.Body>Accordion content</Accordion.Body>

        </Accordion>
    );
};

export default App;
```

### `Accordion.Body`

The `Accordion.Body` slot is used inside an `Accordion.Panel` to define the content area that is shown or hidden when the panel is expanded or collapsed. 
It displays the main content associated with the panel.

#### Properties

| Prop Name   | Type                | Default   | Description                                                                                  |

## Guide

### Retrieve the modified panel's title on change

To detect which panel was last expanded or collapsed:

- Use the `onChange` prop to handle changes in the Accordion's panels.

#### Steps

1. Pass a callback function to the `onChange` prop.
2. The callback receives the `title` of the panel that was most recently expanded or collapsed.

```tsx
import Accordion from '@components/Basic/Accordion/Accordion';

const App = () => {
    const handleChange = (title: string) => {
        console.log(title);
    };

    return (
        <Accordion onChange={handleChange}>
            <Accordion.Panel>
                <Accordion.Heading>Heading 1</Accordion.Heading>
                <Accordion.Body>Accordion content</Accordion.Body>
            </Accordion.Panel>
            <Accordion.Panel>
                <Accordion.Heading>Heading 2</Accordion.Heading>
                <Accordion.Body>Accordion content</Accordion.Body>
            </Accordion.Panel>
        </Accordion>
    );
};

export default App;
```

### Programmatically toggle a panel

The `Accordion` component allows you to programmatically toggle a panel by providing its title as the argument.

#### Steps

1. Create a `ref` variable of type `accordionRef` and assign it to the `Accordion` component.
2. Use the `ref.expand(title)` method to programmatically expand the panel, such as in response to a button click or keyboard event.
3. Use the `ref.collapse(title)` method to programmatically collapse the panel, such as in response to a button click or keyboard event.

```tsx
import Accordion, {accordionRef} from '@components/Basic/Accordion/Accordion';

const App = () => {
    let accordion!: accordionRef;

    const handleKeyPress = (e: KeyboardEvent) => {
        if (e.keyCode === 13) {
            accordionRef.expand('heading-1');
        } else if (e.keyCode === 27) {
            accordionRef.collapse('heading-1');
        }
    };

    return (
        <Accordion ref={accordion} keypress={handleKeyPress}>
            <Accordion.Panel title="heading-1">
                <Accordion.Heading>Heading 1</Accordion.Heading>
                <Accordion.Body>Accordion content</Accordion.Body>
            </Accordion.Panel>
            <Accordion.Panel>
                <Accordion.Heading>Heading 2</Accordion.Heading>
                <Accordion.Body>Accordion content</Accordion.Body>
            </Accordion.Panel>
        </Accordion>
    );
};

export default App;
```

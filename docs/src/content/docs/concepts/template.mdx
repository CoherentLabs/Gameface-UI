This page provides an in-depth explanation of the functionality and usage of GamefaceUI.

The boilerplate project is organized with the following structure:

<FileTree>

- src
  - assets
  - components
    - Basic/
    - Layout/
    - Media/
    - ...
  - custom-components/
  - views
    - hud
      - index.html
      - index.css
      - index.tsx
      - Hud.tsx
      - Hud.module.css
    - menu
      - index.html
      - index.css
      - index.tsx
      - Menu.tsx
      - Menu.module.css
- package.json
- tsconfig.json
- vite.config.mts

</FileTree>

To provide a clearer understanding of the rationale behind this structure, we will explain it in greater detail.

## Project Configuration

The project's configuration is managed through three key files: `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and `vite.config.mts`.

- **`package.json`**: Handles project dependencies and defines scripts for running various commands.
- **`tsconfig.json`**: Specifies TypeScript rules and settings for the project.
- **`vite.config.mts`**: Configures the Vite build tool, setting options and plugins to optimize and transform the source code for Gameface during the build process.

## Assets

The `/src/assets` directory is designated for all UI assets used in the development process. This folder can include files such as `.png`, `.svg`, fonts, and other resources.

## GamefaceUI Components

Predefined components for streamlined UI development are located in the `/src/components` directory. For detailed information about each component and its usage, refer to the [components](/components) section of the documentation.

## Custom Components

The `/src/custom-components` directory is reserved for components created during UI development.

:::tip
We recommend placing all custom components in this folder. This allows you to easily import them using the `@custom-components` alias throughout the project. For more details on using such imports, see the [importing assets and components](/concepts/assets) page.

## Views

Gameface Views are standalone HTML5 pages paired with their respective JavaScript contexts. Each View represents a complete UI or a significant UI component. Since multiple Views can be instantiated, the `/src/views` directory is included in the boilerplate to help organize and manage them effectively. Each View resides in its own folder within `/src/views` and typically includes an `index.html`, `index.css`, and `index.tsx` file, which collectively define its structure, styling, and behavior. This setup allows developers to work on multiple Views efficiently.

:::note
For additional details about Views and how Gameface operates, refer to the following sections of the Gameface documentation:

- [Technical Overview](https://docs.coherent-labs.com/cpp-gameface/integration/technicaloverview/)
- [Rendering Architecture](https://docs.coherent-labs.com/cpp-gameface/integration/rendering/)
- [Cohtml View Class](https://docs.coherent-labs.com/cpp-gameface/api_reference/classes/classcohtml_1_1_view/)

### Creating a View

To create a new View, follow the structure of `src/views/hud` or `src/views/menu`. Begin by creating a new folder `src/views/${viewName}` and include the following files: `index.html`, `index.tsx`, `index.css`, and `${viewName}.tsx`.

:::tip
Although not **mandatory**, it is **recommended** to create a `${viewName}.tsx` file within the `/src/views/${viewName}` folder. This file defines the structure of the entry component rendered by the `index.tsx` file. For instance:

```jsx title="/src/views/hud/index.tsx"
import { render } from 'solid-js/web';
import './index.css';
import Hud from './Hud';

const root = document.getElementById('root');

render(() => <Hud />, root!);
```

The `Hud.tsx` file would then return a JSX element:

```jsx title="/src/views/hud/Hud.tsx"
const Hud = () => {
  return <div>Hello</div>;
};

export default Hud;
```

Using a separate file like `${viewName}.tsx` promotes modularity and simplifies maintenance. It allows you to focus on the component's structure and logic independently, while the `index.tsx` file handles rendering and initialization. This approach is especially beneficial for complex Views with multiple components.

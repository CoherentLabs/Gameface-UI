Working with inline SVGs is advantageous when runtime modifications are required, such as altering the `fill` attribute of a `path` element. Gameface UI simplifies this process, making it easy to implement.

SVGs can be imported as either components or images. Importing an SVG as a component provides access to its DOM elements, enabling programmatic modifications.

## Using SVG as an image

Rendering an `.svg` asset as an image can be achieved through several approaches. However, this method renders the SVG statically, preventing runtime interactions or modifications.

### `<Image>` component

The simplest way to render an SVG as an image is by using the `<Image>` component. Import the SVG and set it as the source for the `Image` component:

```jsx
import Image from '@components/Media/Image/Image';
import logo from '@assets/logo.svg';

const MyComponent = () => {
    return <Image src={logo} />;
};
```

This approach renders the SVG using an `<img>` tag when build, making it static and non-interactive.

### `<BackgroundImage>` component

To use an SVG as a background for an element, the `BackgroundImage` component can be utilized in a similar manner:

```jsx
import BackgroundImage from '@components/Media/BackgroundImage/BackgroundImage';
import logo from '@assets/logo.svg';

const MyComponent = () => {
    return <BackgroundImage src={logo}>Other content here...</BackgroundImage>;
};
```

This method renders the SVG within a `<div>` element with the `background-image` property set, but it does not allow runtime interaction with the SVG.

### `<MaskImage>` component

To apply an SVG as a mask to other elements, the `MaskImage` component can be used:

```jsx
import MaskImage from '@components/Media/MaskImage/MaskImage';
import logo from '@assets/logo.svg';

const MyComponent = () => {
    return <MaskImage src={logo}>Masked content here...</MaskImage>;
};
```

This approach renders the SVG within a `<div>` element with the `mask-image` property set. Like the other methods, it does not support runtime modifications of the SVG.

## Using SVG as component

If you need to modify the SVG runtime and apply interactions to it you need to use the SVG as component.

Let's use the following SVG located at `assets/icon.svg`:

```jsx
<svg width="1041" height="1093" viewBox="0 0 1041 1093" fill="none">
    <path id="1" d="M1035.89 625.051L412.595 4.74938L7.43612 64.5186L450.156 706.635L1034.54 628.858L1035.89 625.051Z" fill="white" stroke="#666666" stroke-width="8"/>
    <path id="2" d="M877.305 1088.51L1034.62 628.829L451.771 707.409L384.432 1088.51L877.305 1088.51Z" fill="white" stroke="#666666" stroke-width="8"/>
</svg>
```

This SVG contains `path` elements with ids `1` and `2`, which we will use to access and modify these elements.

To import the SVG as a component, use the standard import syntax with the `?component-solid` postfix:

```jsx
import Icon from '@assets/icon.svg?component-solid';
```

By using the `?component-solid` postfix, Gameface UI will inline the SVG into the DOM tree during the build process.

:::note
If you import the SVG without the `?component-solid` postfix, it will resolve to the asset's URL. You can then render it using an `img` tag with the URL as the `src` attribute. However, this method does not allow runtime modifications to the SVG.
:::

```jsx
import icon from '@assets/icon.svg';

const Hud = () => {
    return (
        <img src={icon} />
    );
}
```

Once imported, you can render the SVG component within your view:

```jsx
import Icon from '@assets/icon.svg?component-solid';

const Hud = () => {
    return (
        <Icon />
    );
}
```

This approach will inline the `Icon` directly into the HTML when building the UI.

## Modify SVG components at runtime

Since the SVG is rendered as a solid component, you can access its DOM properties and children, allowing for runtime modifications.

To achieve this, add a reference to the SVG component and apply the desired changes:

```jsx
import Icon from '@assets/icon.svg?component-solid';

const Hud = () => {
    let ref: SVGSVGElement;

    return (
        <Icon ref={ref!} />
    );
}
```

For example, to change the fill color of the `path` element with id `1`:

```jsx
import Icon from '@assets/icon.svg?component-solid';

const Hud = () => {
    let ref: SVGSVGElement;

    onMounted(() => {
        setTimeout(() => {
            const path1 = ref.querySelector('#1') as SVGPathElement;
            path1.setAttribute('fill', 'red');
        }, 500);
    });

    return (
        <Icon ref={ref!} />
    );
}
```

This code will change the fill color of the `path` element with id `1` to red, 500ms after the `Hud` component has been mounted.

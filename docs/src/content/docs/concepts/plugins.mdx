To enhance the development experience with GamefaceUI, we have included additional Vite plugins in the boilerplate template we provide. These plugins streamline UI development and address specific issues related to Gameface.

## Plugins

The template currently integrates two custom plugins:

1. **`vite-gameface`**: Ensures the UI is built in an optimized manner, free of errors or warnings when running in Gameface.
2. **`vite-solid-style-to-css`**: Converts styles from the `style` property into CSS classes for improved performance.

## Vite Gameface Plugin

### Resolving Unclosed Tags

SolidJS optimizes the build output by minimizing file size, which includes generating HTML with unclosed tags. However, Gameface requires valid HTML structure and cannot parse files with unclosed tags. This plugin addresses the issue by restructuring the tags into a valid format.

### Fixing SVG Component Attributes

The template project includes SVG components, which introduce compatibility issues with Gameface. When SVG files are transformed into `.tsx` components, the resulting `<svg>` elements may contain unclosed inner tags and attributes without proper quotation marks. These issues prevent Gameface from parsing the SVG elements correctly.

The plugin resolves these problems by reformatting the `<svg>` templates into a valid structure, ensuring compatibility with Gameface.

## Vite solid style to css plugin

The `vite-solid-style-to-css` plugin is designed to convert the `style={{}}` properties into CSS class names. This plugin extracts styles from the `style`, generates unique class names, and moves the styles into a CSS file (for production builds) or a style block (during development). This optimization improves performance by minimizing inline styles and utilizing CSS for better caching and reusability.

### Key Features

* Automatically converts `style={{}}` properties into CSS classes.
* Ensures unique class names to avoid style conflicts.

### Configuration Options

The plugin offers several configuration options to customize its behavior:

* **`suppressWarnings`** (boolean): Default - `false`. Suppresses any warnings generated by the plugin.

For example, if you want to suppress warnings, you can set the `suppressWarnings` option to `true` in your `vite.config.mts` file:

```js ins="suppressWarnings: true"
...
export default defineConfig({
  root: root,
  plugins: [
    solidStyleToCssPlugin({
        suppressWarnings: true
    }),
    ...
  ],
  ...
});
```

### Example

Consider the following source code:

```jsx
const Component = () => {
    return <div style={{ width: '50%', height: '50%' }} />
}
```

The plugin will automatically transform the `div` element into:

```html
<div class="_div_12345"></div>
```

The generated `_div_12345` class will contain the following CSS:

```css
._div_12345 {
    width: 50%;
    height: 50%;
}
```

### Known Behavior

#### Dynamic `style` Properties

When signals are used to dynamically update a style property at runtime, those properties will not be converted into CSS classes.

For instance, consider the following example:

```jsx
const Component = () => {
    const [bgColor, setBgColor] = createSignal('red');

    return <div style={{ height: '50%', 'background-color': bgColor() }} />
}
```

The plugin will transform the `div` element as follows:

```html
<div class="_div_12345" style="background-color: red;"></div>
```

In this case, the `background-color` property remains inline and will be updated dynamically using the `bgColor` signal.

The generated `_div_12345` class will include only the static styles:

```css
._div_12345 {
    height: 50%;
}
```

#### Combining `class` with `style` properties

The plugin assigns unique CSS classes to elements with transformed `style` properties, but there are limitations when combining `style` with the `class` property.

Currently, using the `style` property alongside a spread operator that includes a `class` property is not supported. For example:

```jsx
const Component = () => {
    const additionalProperties = {
        class: 'test-class'
    };

    return <div style={{ height: '50%' }} {...additionalProperties} />;
};
```

In this case, the `style` property for the `div` element will not be transformed. Additionally, if the `suppressWarnings` flag is not set to `true` in the plugin's initialization within the `vite.config.mts` file, a warning will be displayed:

```bash
[vite-style-to-css-plugin] warning: The JSX element <div> contains a "style" attribute along with a spread 
operator ({...additionalProperties}). This combination is not supported, so the styles for this element will not be transformed.
```

Other combinations are supported, and the `style` property will be correctly transformed into a CSS class. For instance:

```jsx
import MyCSSModule from './MyCSSModule.module.css';

const Component = () => {
    const [dynamicClass, setDynamicClass] = createSignal('test-class-1');

    return (
        <div
            style={{ height: '50%' }}
            class={dynamicClass() + ' ' + MyCSSModule.AnotherTestClass + ' test-class-3'}
        />
    );
};
```

`MyCSSModule.module.css`:

```css
.test-class-2 { }
```

This will be transformed into:

```html
<div class="test-class-1 test-class-2 test-class-3 _div_12345"></div>
```

The generated class will always be appended at the end of the `class` attribute.

title: Setting attributes to GamefaceUI components

Sometimes you may need to set an attribute to a GamefaceUI component that is not directly supported by the component itself. In such cases, you can add the attribute to the component using the `attr:*` syntax.
This allows you to set any attribute to the component, even if it is not explicitly defined in the component's props.
For example, if you want to set a custom attribute `data-custom` to a `Button` component, you can do it like this:

```tsx
import Button from '@components/Basic/Button/Button';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <>
            <Button attr:data-custom="some data">Large button</Button>
        </>
    );
};

export default App;
```

This is especially useful when you want to use the data-binding attributes that come with Gameface.

```tsx
import Block from '@components/Layout/Block/Block';

const App = () => {
    return (
        <Block attr:data-bind-value="{{Model.value}}">Some Content</Block>
    );
};

export default App;
```

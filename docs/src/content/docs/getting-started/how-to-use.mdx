GamefaceUI offers two primary ways to get started, depending on whether you want to create a new project from scratch or integrate its components into an existing SolidJS project. You can:

* Download a complete boilerplate template that uses SolidJS with TypeScript and Vite.
* Integrate the components into an existing SolidJS project.

## Using the Boilerplate

The boilerplate is ideal for starting a new project. It comes pre-configured with tools and features to streamline game UI development:

* Vite build tool for efficient development and production builds.
* Vite plugins for an enhanced development experience.
* A structured template to guide your UI implementation. Details about the structure can be found [here](/concepts/template).
* TypeScript for type checking and error prevention.
* Pre-built components for faster UI development.

:::caution
If you choose not to use the boilerplate and only the components, we highly recommend reviewing the boilerplate [here](https://github.com/CoherentLabs/Gameface-UI) to familiarize yourself with its structure, tools, and usage.
:::

To get started with the boilerplate, navigate to your desired directory and run:

```bash
npx degit CoherentLabs/Gameface-UI
```

This command downloads the boilerplate into your current directory.

To create a new directory for the boilerplate, use:

```bash
npx degit CoherentLabs/Gameface-UI NEW_FOLDER
```

Replace `NEW_FOLDER` with your desired folder name.

After downloading the boilerplate, run `npm i` in the directory to install the required dependencies. You can then proceed with building and developing your UI.

## Using Components Only

:::note
To use the components independently, you must have a SolidJS project set up with TypeScript, as GamefaceUI components are written in `.tsx` syntax.
:::

To integrate the components, create a new folder for them and run the following command inside it:

```bash
npx degit CoherentLabs/Gameface-UI/src/components
```

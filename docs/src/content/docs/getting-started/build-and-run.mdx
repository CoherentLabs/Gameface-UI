## Build & run the project in production

To create a production build, run `npm run build` from this folder. This will generate a production build within the `dist` directory.

Each view located in `src/views` will be built into `dist/${viewName}`. For instance, `src/views/hud` will be built in `dist/hud`.

To run the project, open the specific view by loading the `index.html` in the corresponding `dist/${viewName}` directory. For example, to load the hud view, open `dist/hud/index.html`.

## Run in development

To start the project in development mode, run `npm run dev` from this folder. This will start a server on `localhost:${port}`, typically on port `3000`.

To view a specific page during development, navigate to the following URL, for example: `http://localhost:3000/hud/` to load the hud view.

If you are using the `Player.bat` file to open the player and load the UI, you can specify the view url as an argument. For example, to load the hud view you can modify the last line of the `Player.bat` file to look like this:

```bat
start "Player" /d "%wd%" "..\Player\Player.exe" --player "--url=http://localhost:3000/hud/"
```

With the development server running, HOT module replacement will be enabled, so any changes you make will immediately be reflected.
